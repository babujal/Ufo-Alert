## Description

Welcome to UFO Alert, an exciting 2D, two-player game where you control a cannon defending Earth from incoming UFO attacks! But watch out, the other user will be using a UFO with high maneuverability and teleportation staff. When one user's health is zero, the other user receives a score point and an alert announces the win. Then you have the choice to hit the 'play another round' button to go for another try while players keep their score. Refresh the page to start from 0 score.

## Technologies Used

## Approach

1- Started by creating a canvas in HTML .
2- Started creating objects for the players and drawing the player on the canvas and get them to move.
3- Worked on their shoots and realized the js file was getting to crawly and decide to run the game on modules.
4- Create all methods I could inside the objects, others were necessary to build them in a separate js file.
5- Creation of function come on the developing of the site as it got more complicated as I go adding functionalities.
6- Run in to some issues making the bullets separate, The score update was a problem at the beginning.

## Unsolved Problems

1- After one of the players get wiped, the winner player keeps doing his last move until you press the 'play another round' button.
